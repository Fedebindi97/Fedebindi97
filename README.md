- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fedebindi97
- 👀 I’m interested in Bayesian statistics, network (graph) science, and having fun coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL through different practical projects within my company.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools to make data analyst life easier (I have experience with Stata programming, but my codes are work-related and hence confidential).
- 📫 How to reach me: bindi.federico@gmail.com
